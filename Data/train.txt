purring coffeepot élise turcotte poet novelist author sound living thing guyana translated allison charette en français il quelques années demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin écrire de poèmes j ai choisi la vallée de la missisquoi dans le canton de l est en québec parce que j aimais la signification du nom donné par le premières nation à la baie beaucoup oiseaux aquatiques déjà je voyais de oiseaux partout dans me rêves autour de tête derrière le fenêtres je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers le champ de maïs cette région ramenait aussi à mon amour de la afin de choisir le village de mon séjour j avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé mystic ce nom attirait j avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux où il avait dans un musée une salle dédiée à melville je laisse toujours guider par le coïncidences pour écrire j inventais ore et déjà de lien entre melville et le mystic québécois entre moi prenant de note dans une cavalier louée et ce défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont le grand écrivains américains du siècle j imaginais aussi de histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la grange à douze côtés et créais une numérologie intime à moi je chercherais le ponts couverts sur la route le grange rondes construites par de quaker utopiques le maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite de loyalistes vers le nord aux irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine à tous ce immigrant ayant laissé leurs trace sur le chemin je savais qu en aventurant plus loin aux abords du grand lac memphrémagog je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du vietnam je pensais aux abénaquis de premières nation qui ont donné le noms aux lac et aux rivières à notre ignorance à là où mon séjour commençait j ai compris cependant que j étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme j ai posé mille question à une petite historienne de stanbridge station elle indiqué sur la carte où se trouve chemin la deuxième plus belle route du québec je n ai pa jamais appris où se situe la première et je ne suis pa restée à mystic dès que j ai aperçu le vieux cimetière de hunter mill c est la zone frontalière entre le québec et le qui fascinée elle était l illustration de l état dans lequel je trouvais dans l esprit de l errance à la recherche de fantômes le mien ceux de autres à la recherche de me mot terre promise maison construite pierre après pierre tout au long de vie et c est ainsi qu appelée à séjourner dans un petit village je suis retrouvée à ramasser le grain un chapelet de hameaux dispersés sur le chemin de la frontière le décor que j ai trouvé enchante toujours village enclavés dans l ombre de montagnes dont le grandeur veillaient sur le lac longs et le rivières fermes et champ de maïs une mercedes sur quatre bloc à travers le débarras devant une maison à l abandon de vieux cimetières qui surprennent à chaque détour de arbres feuillus érables noyers
